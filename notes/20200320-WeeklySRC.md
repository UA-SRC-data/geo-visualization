Ramona discovered https://capstone-coal.github.io/

- classify land cover and find mineral content, maybe future proposals

GardenRoots & Project Harvest

- clarify the difference between these projects and if there's overlap here or not
  - lack of CS knowledge here (Monica) might confuse CCT and others
    - Projects are separate ... but they are both environmental modeling projects. Harvest is rainwater, Gardenroots is soil and vegetables
      - Because of the large stakeholder groups and ongoing community members, the visualizations are similar but the next steps in visualizatin is up for discussion. She's been doing formative evaluation for visualizations for project harvest.
      - Project Harvest collects data from the same people over time whereas GardenRoots does not
      - Mapping is built in here
      - Monica wants to have an API for Project Harvest, but why not do Garden Roots?
        - Ramona notes that Ken has built an API, could that be re-usable
      - We don't have time in this project to integrate with project harvest, but this may be formative for project harvest
- Jiacheng (Max) shows demo
  - Ramona and Monica seem to understand the histogram filteringg
  - Ramona wants to figure out how the USGS correlates with the garden data
    - Monica needs to figure out which datasets make sense to combine
  - Monica says this is through the census blocks but CCT is making their own partition/grid
    - Ramona says that census blocks and census block groups are designed to represent population
      - Monica likes continuing to work with census blocks/groups because it is interoperable with our other data
- Ken this week
  - See github for a schema of the location/data
     - Will meet with Ramona since it's close to the ontology and it would be nice to match
  - Still has interface from last week, but made it more general
  - Will get up VM soon so we (vis) can play with it
