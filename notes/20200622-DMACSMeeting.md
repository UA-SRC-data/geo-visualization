Monica, Raina, Michelle, Nirav, Kate

Monica & Kate give overview of internal use case

- Scientific use case as well for geo scientists
- Note currrently served on CALS
  - Nirav isn't concerned so much about that
- Kate has concerns about model building
- Kate has naming concerns between IUC and DMACS, given the ontology
- Want to help policymakers as much as scientists
  - Possibly decision support tool
    - Raina says for policymakers, citizens, and industry
    - Monica says this has been done with disaster management resources
      - Especially the idea of building resiliency... find out where you can increase resiliency 
    - Nirav thinks how can we generalize this because other projects can learn from this
    
Michelle has pretty good full stack experience. Nirav is concerned about the software engineering culture of our group and Michelle brings that to the table.
