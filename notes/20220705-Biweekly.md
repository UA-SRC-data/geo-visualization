- Monica, Kate, Jackson, Alma


- Alma is showing the variables she's found and those that are missing
  - Monica says some of those we may need to derive with the help of the database and the visualization
- Monica says anything in the Frontiers papers that's missing has to be put in the database ASAP
- USDA ERS
  - Monica finds some flat files (?)
    - thinks Dorsey already downloaded htem
  - I point out we need to put it in the database (or do we?)
    - then Alma can match the IDs
    - Jackson points out those ones so far are ontology IDs not database IDs
      - Okay so we put that off for now.
  - I point out the central scrutinizer because that's always online
    - Monica says it doesn't have USDA in it looking at the drop down.
- Jackson shows the Contaminents UI that we started with
  - He notes that he's pulling them from the ontology and a spreadsheet he cobbled together from the Github (to show which ones exist)
  - If you select Aluminum, then the mediums are populated with a bunch of stuff, less for Antimony
  - He points out the multiple "top soil" for Aluminum (yard versus top) 
    - I ask about whether we need a third drop down 
      - Jackson et al remind we would just bring up the multiple datasets as different layers
  - He also shows how it then populates the search with the ontology term.
  - He further points out that despite having a lot of media for arscenic, only two are in the database
    - Monica finds this strange because we have found them in the Github
    - So what's the best way to associate ontology term with database
      - Jackson and I both like adding a column to the database for this
        - I consider normalization but then worry that makes it harder for people to download, so adding the column makes sense
        - I pont out this will also allow him to side-step the spreadsheet.
- Jackson and Alma are still going through the tables together
  - Next thing for Jackson individually would be to look through the database.
    - He's going to test if he can add the ontology column
