- Monica, Kate, Jackson, Alma


- Alma is showing the variables she's found and those that are missing
  - Monica says some of those we may need to derive with the help of the database and the visualization
- Monica says anything in the Frontiers papers that's missing has to be put in the database ASAP
- USDA ERS
  - Monica finds some flat files (?)
    - thinks Dorsey already downloaded htem
  - I point out we need to put it in the database (or do we?)
    - then Alma can match the IDs
    - Jackson points out those ones so far are ontology IDs not database IDs
      - Okay so we put that off for now.
  - I point out the central scrutinizer because that's always online
    - Monica says it doesn't have USDA in it looking at the drop down.
