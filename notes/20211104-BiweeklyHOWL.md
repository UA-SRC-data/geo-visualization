Kate, Dorsey, Jackson, Thu, Monica


Jackson shows off how far he's gotten with the look & feel redesign.

Since neighborhoods are hard to get, we can start with drop a pin or zip code

- some future project can get city ward maps, maybe a class project

Thu shows printing to PDF

- Kate recommends https://github.com/grinat/leaflet-simple-map-screenshoter

Thu shows address search

- Dorsey suggests filtering out non-Arizona addresses
- Dorsey also asks about search by zip code and drop with a pin
- Monica asks about the scale of the map since Concentration of as is not very high
  - We decide all the values are just very small
  - Monica suggests we can suggest other scales than just the EPA levels
    - Monica suggests doing a low to high scale
      - Kate asks zero to high or low to high?
        - Some you'd want the limit of detection
          - Monica still likes going with what the values are.
            - "low to high" implies the low values are truly low
              - Kate suggests "minimum to maximum"
    - Monica also likes having an adjustable scale
      - Want a risk-based value and a screening value... in arsenic this is 1 and 10 respectively
    - Project Harvest gives the average across all samples submitted 
    - Also show the full range of everything in the database
