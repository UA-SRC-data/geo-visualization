Dorsey is trying to get more of the storyboards together

- Go back to layers in the multivaraite mapping
  - also an ability to not only download the visualization but send a link to the visualizaiton's state (this fits this idea of collaboration and sharing) (Jackson is working on this)
  - Monica suggests the ability to annotate/pin things of interest
    - Possibly alert people who sign up
    - We do need a lot of ability to annotation
      - Need to do account management and verification
    - See map-pollution existing app, tell-your-pollution story, reportpollution.org
      - possibly be a calendar
- Jackson do more with the ontology stuff

Reminder of the VIS lighting talks

- Dorsey is interested
