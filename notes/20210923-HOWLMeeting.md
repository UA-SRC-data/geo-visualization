Dorsey is trying to get more of the storyboards together

- Go back to layers in the multivaraite mapping
  - also an ability to not only download the visualization but send a link to the visualizaiton's state (this fits this idea of collaboration and sharing)
- Jackson do more with the ontology stuff

Reminder of the VIS lighting talks

- Dorsey is interested
