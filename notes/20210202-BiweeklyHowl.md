Dorsey, Jackson, Kate, Alma, Monica

Jackson has added the legends and histogram and improved the outline visualization on the map.

Dorsey says surveys favor EJScreen followed by Public Health tracking so she's pulling from those more for the design.

We're still waiting on data science team for the ontology.

Dorsey has sent details and quick help stuff to Vis team, makes a tutorial.

- clarify as we're building out what each thing can do --- so the tutorial will help us build it better
- image with letters & numbers... I wonder if we can make some of these hoverable.

- public health tracking has a link to an API, do we want to expose ours or just show a link?
  - we want to make sure what their exact search could be saved and shared
  - next advanced level is the access to the scrutinizer to pull raw data
  - Kate suggests auto twitter share with an image and the link (or some other social media)
  - Jackson looked at how we wanted to do sharing. Currently it just copies the link to your clipboard which is what we want to do except with some pop up to make it clear what it's doing.
    - he looked at linking to twitter, but you have to link all of those specifically... but you have to do it per social media site... which ones? reddit? facebook? insta?
      - Kate suggests maybe that goes into the comment link?
      - Kate also suggests turning the share button into a drop down
      - Facebook is used by the communities but of course there are issues with Facebook
  - Dorsey suggests doing clipboard link first and exploring possibilities in the future
  - Dorsey notes there's a difference between share and export because it's a different thing (Monica was asking about saving reports in EJScreen)

- table & chart formats through another tab
  - has some ability to brush select the full graph to show everything or top 4 or whatever and export that.
  - Jackson asks if you do it by census block.
    - Dorsey expects we'll never draw the whole thing
    - Monica suggests drawing block groups by county
    - Kate talks about brushing and trying to see where a zip code falls regarding the counties, so these are all things we can think about
    - Monica points out EJScreen allows you to select and see a radius around it.
      - Dorsey points out if county is sleected, show counties, if block group is selected, show block groups around it rather than all of them
        - Note from Kate: Level of Detail and closeness principles
  - Kate is concerned with the scroll idiom

- About Data screen
 - with open-able tabs with definitions, citation information, etc.

- Map layers
  - EJScreen shows point data
    - but tons of schools in Phoenix, how do we show?
      - maybe in some cases have exact location, in some have heat map
    - Monica says EJScreen pulls superfund but it's unclear if it's pulling brown fields or wastewater discharge through some algorithm
  - how do we get superfund sites?
    - EPA has all federally designated clean up sites in 'show cleanup sites near me' which is superfund and others
    - It's uncleared where DoD sites appear
   - Monica suggests layers that show vulnerabilities and resiliencies... so you could cateogorize them
     - This is less broad and more focused on our mission

- Compare your block group to the county and the state
  - in the future, being able to check versus stratifications like wealth
