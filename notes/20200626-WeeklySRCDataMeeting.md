Kai, Kate, Monica, Ken

Monica briefs on DMACS meeting earlier with Nirav.

- Wanting to bring up group as a whole (professional groups)

Monica will now share "Open Citizen Sciencd Data and Methods" call in Frontiers, October 22 deadline

- Email link going
- Everyone read and brainstorm ideas for next week
  - but Ramona won't be back? Or will she? Unclear?
- Notes to/from Kate: see related work on citizen science + vis needs

See what Kai and Ken are doing with vis

- separate project

Kai: Data stuff

- Priyanka still working on headers
- Dorsey looking at ACS, has stuff to show, will get to EJScreen
  - This is from the vars.csv, Ken has taught some tidyverse stuff to find variables for visualization (also using `tidycensus`)
    - vars doesn't seem to have strateification, R strips the ends with the 'E'
    - tidycensus is better at stratifying
  - Dorsey will load vars.csv into a tidy dataframe to help check out the discrepancies
- Ken said he just needs the variables names however
  - He's confused by the E versus not E thing too
  - Non-E doesn't come up from the API
  - Ken needs columnn names
- Discussion of the year, they will mismatch
  - Kate re-states original rationale of "if we want to show what it is right now, let's use the latest data we have" (w/possible future temporal regressions as needed)
  
Monica/Priyanka data:

- Kai trying to figure out how to put it into an ontology
  - Well v. Aquafer v. Potable
  - Mine tailings v. Compost (3 levels)
  - In situ data different than experimental, how does this fit models? Not well right now, application centric ontology?
- What to pull? What can be a sign of resiliency?
