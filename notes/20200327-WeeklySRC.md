We're supposed to have all of the data downloaded and organized by the end of the month. We're a little behind but we're ahead on other things.

- EJScreen by block group (USGS?)
  - povery levels
- Census by block
  - access to medical care
  - medium household income
  - employment & occupationnal diversity
- Ken also workinng on Chris' water-chemistry data from the school of mines
- Monica thinks we may wantn to present the data at one scale only which would then be block group
  - CCT folks have been creating their own grid
  - Focus on EJScreen data over Census data but need Census data for healthcare, internet access, mobile & in-home, voting information
    - So let's do this at the group level
      - Do we change all GardenRoots data to the block-group level?
    - In Monica's experience, mobile and home internet are of interest, esp. because people may have mobile but not home access

- standards in gardenroots data Ramona asks
  - usually shown as a horizontal line versus the values
  - in our vis, shown with the color map
- nothing in the cell meanns no value
  - no standard?
  - some cells are missing LOD (level of detection) due to machine records at lab who did that

- Monica finds the following definitions (https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/about/glossary.html):

Blocks (Census Blocks) are statistical areas bounded by visible features, such as streets, roads, streams, and railroad tracks, and by nonvisible boundaries, such as selected property lines and city, township, school district, and county limits and short line-of-sight extensions of streets and roads. Generally, census blocks are small in area; for example, a block in a city bounded on all sides by streets. Census blocks in suburban and rural areas may be large, irregular, and bounded by a variety of features, such as roads, streams, and transmission lines. In remote areas, census blocks may encompass hundreds of square miles. Census blocks cover the entire territory of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas. Census blocks nest within all other tabulated census geographic entities and are the basis for all tabulated data.

Block Groups (BGs) are statistical divisions of census tracts, are generally defined to contain between 600 and 3,000 people, and are used to present data and control block numbering.  A block group consists of clusters of blocks within the same census tract that have the same first digit of their four-digit census block number.  For example, blocks 3001, 3002, 3003, . . ., 3999 in census tract 1210.02 belong to BG 3 in that census tract.  Most BGs were delineated by local participants in the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program.  The Census Bureau delineated BGs only where a local or tribal government declined to participate, and a regional organization or State Data Center was not available to participate.

A BG usually covers a contiguous area.  Each census tract contains at least one BG, and BGs are uniquely numbered within the census tract.  Within the standard census geographic hierarchy, BGs never cross state, county, or census tract boundaries but may cross the boundaries of any other geographic entity.  Tribal census tracts and tribal BGs are separate and unique geographic areas defined within federally recognized American Indian reservations and can cross state and county boundaries (see "Tribal Census Tract" and "Tribal Block Group").  The tribal census tracts and tribal block groups may be completely different from the census tracts and block groups defined by state and county.
