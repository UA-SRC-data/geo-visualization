Still unclear whether Project Harvest/Ours should be merged

Ramona will update data shortly

Ken showing EJScreen data

- He only grabs the AZ stuff, `04` is the state code... it goes state-county-block in terms of the block_id
  - Now he's working on integrating with data that uses words like `Yavapaid County, tract 1` but it should be doable
  - We only need four counties... maybe we should have four different maps --- one for each county
  - Need to transform percentile data and associate with ontology
- Colorado School of Mines (Chris's data) web now working
- Ramona likes idea of they put data into relational database, then we clean it, then we put it into template we need
  - Ken "the data /canonically/ lives in a relational database
    - Ramona agrees and then talks about adding the ephemeroptera "?" (Chris says that is the "order"... I guess like family/genus) like the ontology


Ramona asks that Jiacheng collate all data at the block_group level to meet EJ Screen

  - I think we need to keep both
