Dorsey has done the units document.

Ramona... close to getting ontology working but there's a few things that are not compiling.

- notes to Jackson regarding the Plant phenology classifies everything as "qualities" all grouped under the root "category". In ACS, it will be different in part because she's trying to tie it into existing ontologies, so there are things like "count" and "percentages"
