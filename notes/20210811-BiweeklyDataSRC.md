Kate, Ramona, Dorsey, Jackson, Monica

Dorsey has done the units document.

Ramona... close to getting ontology working but there's a few things that are not compiling.

- notes to Jackson regarding the Plant phenology classifies everything as "qualities" all grouped under the root "category". In ACS, it will be different in part because she's trying to tie it into existing ontologies, so there are things like "count" and "percentages". These are not "qualities" but are "measurement datum".
  - so everything will be under "measurement datum" instead of "quality". That's the hierarchy that we're going to need to use.
  - may need a separate meeting to go over it with Jackson
  - points Jackson to this git hub organization and the ontology under it, suggests opening it in protege
    - suggests 'ELK reasoner'(?) and then in the class hierarchy, check out the inferred hierarchy... may need to install that reasoner
    - Jackson asks if there's something to map the data to the ontology
      - Ramona also suggests the data loaders repository, EJSCREEN, GARDENROOTS, USGS etc are ours, and in each of them there is 

Dorsey points out some new spreadsheets with some units discrepanices (e.g., count of people vs. count of households)

Kate is doing the data science teachers thing, no one else is, so she'll cover this.

Alma is doing the research into what people think affect vulnerability

Jackson shows the search panel and talks about the ambiguity.

- Dorsey wants the example from the mock up.
- Dorsey believes in search panel too, but thinks the panel where you can see all the variables we have is more important
