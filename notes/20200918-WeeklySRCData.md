Dorsey, Raina, Priyanka, Kate, Monica, Ramona

Won't meet for next two weeks.

Monica had a few more questions/examples for the data portal.

* Can we come up with a vulnerability index number with our data?
* Can we do the same with health?
* Can we see that mining communities are disproportionally exposed to arsenic?
  * Correlated with asthma, diabetes, etc?
    * Note from Kate: Can we show arsenic versus these diseases at the same time... is this a good bivariate color map?
    * Note from Kate: Bivariate cartograms?
      * VIS problem: how to group since census-block grroups too small to tell
* What are the resiliencies?
  * The whole tables stuff like LineUp may make sense here
  
  
Dorsey may be able to get census tract health data but we may not be able to make it public. Also it will be about ~$1800 and we will need to become SSS. This is the data the CDC uses.
