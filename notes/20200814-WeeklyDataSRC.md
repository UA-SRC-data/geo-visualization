- but it would be only the Gardenroots, not the rest
  - Monica said it would be about facilitating the re-use for others
    - Monica will get and outline + material we already have
    
Ontology + Design Patterns

- Kai needs to push that to the github
- What is the "design pattern"
  - Protege is ontology editing software, they open .owl file in it
    - Protege is fine grain, OWL is ontology web language, you can edit one class at a time
    - Alternatively, design pattern can help do things more programmatically
    - Axiom is a relationship between classes within ontologies
    - Hierarchy can be inferred using Axioms

- Kate points out that covid data is easy to add into the portal, but it might not be in the ontology
  - Ramona points out there are other ontologies for that
    - Kai suggests we could also mint stuff that's not machine-inferrrable but is discoverable so it ends up in the same data file on export
      - We might already do that with the EJScreen anyway, so covid data makes sense in that regard
      - Monica adds in diabetes rates and so forth which will be similarr
        - Ramona says they seem to only have those for Phoenix metro
          - Monica will look for other sources
          
Not meeting next week.

In two weeks, we'll explain how we're using the spreadsheets without Protege

Kate/Michelle look into AZ data.
