Monica, Dorsey, Kate, Bianca (11 AM meeting after 10am weekly data src)

Introductions

Dorsey has been looking at other web interfaces that map vulnerability, finding four main interfaces

1. EJ Screen

- we are using their data
- combines env & demographic data to figure out disproportinate impact of pollution
- built on ESRI, called "EnviroMapper"... 3/4 interfaces are powered by ESRI
- location drop down -- brings up a dialog for location source, specific text boxes but you can drop a marker or do address search
  - then bring up reports with tabs
    - shows comparison of location to city, state, & US
- add maps drop down & starts addinng map layers as colors
  - this looks like a job for small multiples
  - they do side-by-side maps, not layering
    - link naviggation
    - but color maps are not linked
    - can we do Onset Maps to show simultaneous vulnerability?
      - with small mulitples that show all combos (to a point), maybe cluster by what's similar
- can give markers meaningg (e.g., schools) so they have that data
- Dorsey critique: unless you. go through tutorial video, it's hard to understand diff between env indicatosrs and EJ index
- she really uses the address search quite a bit, but that might just be to ground us, what do they need?
 - Kate asks about location vs. areas
    - citizens want locations (their location)
    - publlic policy/gov't agency type might want to see 5-10 miles around site they are managing
      - use for communication strategy or clean up strategy
      - Dorsey points out there are measurement tools so you can draw areas
- Dorsey says there are so many features it took her a while to use, but prefers simpler in other ones that break it down so you get something right away

2. Social Vulnerabilty Index Interactive Map (SVI)

- social vulnnerablity fo census tracks
- they've already scored all sites. and say what 4 themes go into it (15 variables total)
  - can color by. themes rather than total too
- also ESRI, also choropleth
- shows year drop down
- slide out menu with intro/instructions + interactive legennd
- once again, click for floatign menu with details
  - including bar chart and data tables
- does allow you to layer
  - by color, using lightening/darkening
- Monica notes this was orriginally for disaster preparerdness and response -- so FEMA can understannd why some communities bounnce back faster

3.  Tracking Network by CDC

- Dorsey's fave in terms of usability, very intuitive
  -  Monica notes CDC & Agency for Toxic Substances does great plain language materials for people
  - Dorsey really likes the tour-this-page
  - also pop up windows to tell you more about the data
- brring toggether health and env data
- side by side by default
- First screen with drrop downs &. combo boxes to select the data you want to populate one map
- bar grarphs and tables under map can be generated and downloaded... turn a view into a CSV! Easy toggle
  - Dorsey says this is really. important for a lot of different audiences
- Dorsey also really likes the "clear data" button
- no data is clear because there's no overlay
- interrestingly both this and previous use the  yellow/green/blue color map

4. Health Landscape - Population Health Mapper

- another choropleth layers map
- each data variable has a slider so you can change the bin yourself
  - not scented though, could be scennted
    - only two bins though
      - but you can two multi variables at the same time to dice into more categories -- therreforre see places with multiple problems
  - feels the slider shows counties popping in and out in the set
  - can get a regression line between variables
  
Dorsey will now think about look and feel that incorporates favorite design features

Monica brings up starting with everrything or addinng it as needed and what is easier

Kate brings up small multiples, Onset, and scented widgets

- Monica likes the scented widgets on Kayak 

Monica brings up traditional maps at AZ, azdeq.gov/emaps

- also ESRI
- lots of layer markers to add
- her state contacts go immediately to these maps for internal understanding and to do notifications.

Story map is having maps inside a Snowfall story/visualization, aka Parallax article
