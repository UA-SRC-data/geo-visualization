Monica, Dorsey, Kate, Bianca (11 AM meeting after 10am weekly data src)

Introductions

Dorsey has been looking at other web interfaces that map vulnerability, finding four main interfaces

1. EJ Screen

- we are using their data
- combines env & demographic data to figure out disproportinate impact of pollution
- built on ESRI, called "EnviroMapper"... 3/4 interfaces are powered by ESRI
- location drop down -- brings up a dialog for location source, specific text boxes but you can drop a marker or do address search
  - then bring up reports with tabs
    - shows comparison of location to city, state, & US
- add maps drop down & starts addinng map layers as colors
  - this looks like a job for small multiples
  - they do side-by-side maps, not layering
    - link naviggation
    - but color maps are not linked
    - can we do Upset Maps to show simultaneous vulnerability?
      - with small mulitples that show all combos (to a point), maybe cluster by what's similar
- can give markers meaningg (e.g., schools) so they have that data
- Dorsey critique: unless you. go through tutorial video, it's hard to understand diff between env indicatosrs and EJ index
- she really uses the address search quite a bit, but that might just be to ground us, what do they need?
 - Kate asks about location vs. areas
    - citizens want locations (their location)
    - publlic policy/gov't agency type might want to see 5-10 miles around site they are managing
      - use for communication strategy or clean up strategy
      - Dorsey points out there are measurement tools so you can draw areas
- Dorsey says there are so many features it took her a while to use, but prefers simpler in other ones that break it down so you get something right away

2. Social Vulnerabilty Index Interactive Map (SVI)

- social vulnnerablity fo census tracks
- they've already scored all sites. and say what 4 themes go into it (15 variables total)
  - can color by. themes rather than total too
- also ESRI, also choropleth
- shows year drop down
- slide out menu with intro/instructions + interactive legennd
- once again, click for floatign menu with details
  - including bar chart and data tables
- does allow you to layer
  - by color, using lightening/darkening
- Monica notes this was orriginally for disaster preparerdness and response -- so FEMA can understannd why some communities bounnce back faster
