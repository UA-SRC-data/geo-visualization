Introductions

Dorsey has been looking at other web interfaces that map vulnerability, finding four main interfaces

1. EJ Screen

- we are using their data
- combines env & demographic data to figure out disproportinate impact of pollution
- built on ESRI, called "EnviroMapper"... 3/4 interfaces are powered by ESRI
- location drop down -- brings up a dialog for location source, specific text boxes but you can drop a marker or do address search
  - then bring up reports with tabs
    - shows comparison of location to city, state, & US
- add maps drop down & starts addinng map layers as colors
  - this looks like a job for small multiples
  - they do side-by-side maps, not layering
    - link naviggation
    - but color maps are not linked
    - can we do Upset Maps to show simultaneous vulnerability?
- can give markers meaningg (e.g., schools) so they have that data
- Dorsey critique: unless you. go through tutorial video, it's hard to understand diff between env indicatosrs and EJ index
- she really uses the address search quite a bit, but that might just be to ground us, what do they need?
 - Kate asks about location vs. areas
    - citizens want locations (their location)
    - publlic policy/gov't agency type might want to see 5-10 miles around site they are managing
      - use for communication strategy or clean up strategy
      - Dorsey points out there are measurement tools so you can draw areas
