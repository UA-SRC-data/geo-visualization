Kai, Ken, Ramona, Raina, Monica, Priyanka, Dorsey, Michelle

Ken is leaving us in two weeks, will be joining Critical Path (non-profit to expedite drug discovery)

- We can hire him hourly/daily if we need to, will try to transfer all knowledge but still need consulting
- Kate & Monica will look for a grad who knows Python and can do this
- Finish off unit problems w/Kai
- Still rate-limited on the ACS data, but getting there
  - Do we want the data for the WHOLE state? That would take longer
    - Ken is concernedd on the size
    - Monica wants to be able to compare algorithms to other parts of the state for validation
      - Can it be gotten later Kai/Ramona?
        - Monica is worried about getting it later
          - But we have reproducibility in our workflow, so it shouldn't be a problem

Michelle working on the data management core

- Getting analyses on Cyverse
- TBD

Vegetable ontologies coming

Diabetes data (Nhanes)

- Monica looking through it, has both diagnosed and undiagnosed (possibly based on hospital visits)
  - 5-10 different questions of biomonitoring/interviews of population across the US
    - combined with population from census
    - so which do we use?
      - Monica still trying to find the CSV
      - We want the ones where they decide one way or another, not the details of symptoms
