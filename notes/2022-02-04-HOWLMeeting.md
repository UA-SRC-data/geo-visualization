Monica, Dorsey, Kate, Jackson, Thu, Alma

- now mockup all in XD
- ontology status unclear, Monica says to ask about hirinig someone if we run into a problem
  - this is when I asked about how we might tell that some of the filters are mutually exclusive and some stack
- the topic/metric can possibly have a third tier ("indicator")
- may want to add scrollbars to all of these
- shows how handles work on the histogram, I suggest not completely removing the unselected bars, so people can see the whole thing
- there's all the chart view
  - drag the bar to see fewer bars
  - Jackson asks how they know what it is if they're dragging it
  - I ask why we would do this
    - Dorsey says it's for the share and export feature, so people can share -- so when you have both windows linked you could show both windows at the same time, the map view and the chart view
      - Kind of like a simpler linked view.
- share variables are what's necessary to re-constitute the visualization from an URL, also to the scrutinizer to server
- there's also the download to export the data
  - they can select PNG, CSV, PDF etc.
  - Monica asks why CSV is under Map, Graph, AND Table... isn't in the same?
    - It is, so we stick it onto the right as a fourth category for CSV
    - Alma asks about downloading in excel format
- when people click on "select data", it will bring things up in their selection panel
  - this supports the user in the ability to make small changes their selection/adjustment
- also shows tool tips of how to show scores
  - has custom report that shows things like the different categories, the percnetiles compared to state and local percentiles
  - Jackson asks where the different categories come from
    - Even if we took a single category (e.g., with Dial up), it will also give us all the other siblings in a category
- We talk about making the indices up front from the topic
  - Jackson suggests we name it the "HOWL Resiliency Index" so everything is marked as being HOWL
  - Maybe we show HOWL versus Community vs Raw Data
    - This might suggest a third drop down, though Dorsey likes the sub-headers
    - Thre are needs assessment and Garden Roots so that's a lot under community
    - Kate suggests keeping them together to help with type-ahead search

Random note from Kate
- when we do things by census tract, can we immediately have Phoenix and Tucson insets
