Monica, Dorsey, Kate, Jackson, Thu, Alma

- now mockup all in XD
- ontology status unclear, Monica says to ask about hirinig someone if we run into a problem
  - this is when I asked about how we might tell that some of the filters are mutually exclusive and some stack
- the topic/metric can possibly have a third tier ("indicator")
- may want to add scrollbars to all of these
- shows how handles work on the histogram, I suggest not completely removing the unselected bars, so people can see the whole thing
- there's all the chart view
  - drag the bar to see fewer bars
  - Jackson asks how they know what it is if they're dragging it
  - I ask why we would do this
    - Dorsey says it's for the share and export feature, so people can share -- so when you have both windows linked you could show both windows at the same time, the map view and the chart view
