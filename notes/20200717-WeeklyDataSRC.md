Raina, Priyanka, Monica, Kai, Ramona, Ken, Dorsey, Kate, John

Frontiers paper - Monica will take the lead

Data Integration / Ontology - Env Health Perspectives - Ramona will take the lead

- Will get an Introduction done for next week

Supplemental Data meeting come in September, will show results there

- Want prototype ready for it
- What does that mean for budget timeline?
  - Raina will look
  
  Ken on data
  
  - 1200 some variables from Monica/Dorsey
    - Ken is going through the four sites for it but he gets throttled by rate limits
  - Creates CSV for each variable, for each county
    - triples of variable, value, census block
  - Then processes that into something with more metadata (e.g., variable description, location type, year, medium)
    - Variable descrription too long in the dropdown, is a pain
      - Ramona/Kai will develop short ontology names
  - School of Mines data has same format, but kept separate
  - Monica says environmental *indicators* are enough from EJ, over environmental *indices*
    - EJ merges demographic and environmental
    - We pull demographic from census
      - We will thus have our own we calculate and can use EJ's indices to validate, e.g., "Are we within 10-20% of some of the ranges?"
    - Dorsey says it is sometimes calls *factor* rather than *indicator*
    - Ken says he has all of EJScreen
 - Kai points out we have unit issues... similar measurements with different units, will need to clean that up

GardenRoots

- Ramona asks about metals for vegetables, wants vegetable classification source for ontology
  - Monica says it's World Health Organization's Codex Alimentarius, but if there's something else, we should consider that
    - WHO only has that for cadmium and lead
    - Ramona will also reach out to food and agriculture ontology people in case there's something else
    
Monica found another database we should consider:

- CDC has registry data
  - cancer registry
  - asthma, obesity, diabetes rates
