  Ken on data
  
  - 1200 some variables from Monica/Dorsey
    - Ken is going through the four sites for it but he gets throttled by rate limits
  - Creates CSV for each variable, for each county
    - triples of variable, value, census block
  - Then processes that into something with more metadata (e.g., variable description, location type, year, medium)
