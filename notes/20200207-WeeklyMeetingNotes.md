Priyanka has more datasets to combine for CSM UA metadata   

  - No updates on the UCSD version of the project
  - Just put it in a folder named "unclean data" for now... well now that it's unclean... it just hasn't been processed
  
CJK answering questions about resolution and having to adjust the dataset for taxonomic resolution, hope to get header list to Ken for next week  
  
  - Some data normalized on grid system so it rs
  
 Ken playing around with an interface for CENSUS data
 
 - JSON  
 - has a front end to list it  
 - CENSUS data is pretty weird, really long column headers and they're multiple levels  
 - Going to put it into sqlite database  
 - Monica is used to look at the tables through the viewer interface online     
   - QuickFacts lets her filter by location (Arizona) in a big table and also filter by topics     
   - We want that level of detail per town --- census block information     
   - We have environmental marker information  
   - Monica did send an image of what's expected so look closely at that     
     - That is what Ken is pulling
  
  
Ramona wants everyone to have backup raw data

Can we include data from multiple years?

Let's link the map to a bunch of timeline charts that can be queried as needed so we will probably need golden layout

CALS server have to figure out

We have more data now for GardenRoots

We also want USGS data for soil characteristics... map where we don't have data or the base layer

Monica hopes to see multiple variables but group them as vulnerability and resilience 

 - We need to come up with equations for what that is- Really sounds like we need to integrate some models
