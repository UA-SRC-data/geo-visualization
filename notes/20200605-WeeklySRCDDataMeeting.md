Ramona asks Monica what to do with below detection limit data?

- Half of detection limit?
  - Chris says those metal values just report at "Below Detection Limit" and how it's analyzed is up to the person using the data
  - Half LOD is what Monica visualizes it
    - Reports at BDL for publicationn
- Never report a zero!
- Need to choose a consistent label -- we'll do BDL
