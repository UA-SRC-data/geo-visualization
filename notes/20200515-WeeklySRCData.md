Kate,  Monica, Ramona, Raina, Ken, Priyanka

This meeting is Monica explaining to us which fields are the same or not

Monica says there are cleanups near where you live and they break it into categories based on what government bodies manage them. RMP and TSDS, one of them is pulling from an inventory about who is releasing through permit. You as a citizen should know what that is releasing.

- They are using a scoring, so we need to understand if it's rolling 3 month or what
- We are going to have to layer many things

Discussion of how to map into percentiles via ontology.

American Community Survey (ACS5) too big to download, we need to pick what we want through the web API.

- Ramona will try to map these variables to ontology
  - Cellular coverage in use might be difficult
  
Monica suggests a journal paper, special issue for citizen science

- Interoperability with citizen science data
- Abstract submissions now
