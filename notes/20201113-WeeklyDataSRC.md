Ramona, Dorsey, Raina, Monica, Kate

Dorsey is using Tableau with TIGR line shape files to see if she can join data so she can draw it in Tableau.

- Tableau isn't super fast.
- Need to figurre out how to llinnk directly,  copying through Excel is suppressing leading zeroes
  - Need to Dorsey/Bianca meet to ese if we can do this through the scrutinizer
- Dorsey points out we should have county name as a column
  - we have tracts, not sure how that matches with county
- Ramona suggests we standardize on terms from Darwin Core (location ID, county, breakinng lat/long into two fields, verbatim locality?)
- Dorsey also heard back from RDC
  - No mapping is allowed by them, but we can create indices internally and they want to see the whole draft
  - Also, they only give things to the county level and that's still restricted use though available on their website
    - maybe they mean that for visualization only
  - We may want to compare across states 

Ramona asks what other metadata we want to colllect

- Monica says: data source, year, depth (top 5cm, top 6 inches etc), type of water (surface, drinking, ground, irritgation, etc), fresh weight v. dry weight, plant family (taxon)
  - want year rather than date because unclear what exact date means... collection date v. chain of custody date
- Ramona wonders about 'who collected it'
