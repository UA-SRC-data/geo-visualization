Matt presenting this month. He's a post-doc in Donna's lab.

- Topic: Chronic Arsenic and relation to Diabetes
- You can get it in well water, there's one enzyme that methylizes so you can remove it
- There are maps, by total, not capita... that's surprising
  - Raina points out we all get exposed sometimes in our lives... so what can we tell about chronic versus sometimes etc?
    - And how does water treatment help given what we found out above.
- Related to "non-canonical" NRF2 path, NRF2 is oxidation regulator
- They use the term "model" to describe the factors in their experiments and show a combinatorial tree
  - they start seeing blood glucose changes in 1-2 weeks but realistically it takes 2-4 months to see pronounced changegs, even then not that huge
- generated an RNAseq dataset with 30,000 genes mapped, 66 genes upregulated, 106 downregulated
- node-link diagram that's a circular laoyout with an addedd tree, nodes were factors
  - then there's a pathway diagram
