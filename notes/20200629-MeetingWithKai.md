planetmicrobe.org - marine metagenomic data interoperable with ontologies for FAIR 

- bunch of selectors on the side (dynamic queries)
- google maps map
- table of samples
- ontology terms used for filterring (could be used by controlled vocabulary too)
  - however, what the ontology helps with... concentrations, he shows this in EO ontology as a hierarchy because it gives the specific terms the whole tree of meeting
    - So you can build relations like mad libs
      - sparql helps do queries that have wildcards in the mad libs
        - sparql can do topology queries
  - Kai would like to add a sparql query to whatever we do
- frictionless data packages let them do and/or filters
- they expect people to use this website to help them select the data they want and eventually figure out how to use it to do other analysis

- we talk about resilience
  - Kate wonders if we can do a diff between two sites/groups to show good v. bad as a colored list
    - Kai concerned we don't have good/bad labeling (so we may only have ideas of how resilient things are)
- CSV to RDF triples (that can be ontology queried) and eventually database (for speed once you've done it)
